# Financial Distress Analysis of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Using Altman Z-Score (FY2024)

This project evaluates the financial distress risk and credit strength of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd using the Altman Z-Score model.

- **Altman Z-Score** → Predicts bankruptcy risk (result: 15.06 → deep in Safe Zone, >>2.99)

The analysis indicates negligible bankruptcy risk, driven by strong liquidity, profitability, solvency, and market equity value.

## Key Findings Summary
- **Z-Score**: 15.06 (Safe Zone – very low distress risk)
- Key Drivers: High X4 (Market Value of Equity / Total Liabilities = 22.46), reflecting strong investor confidence; solid X1 (liquidity) and X2 (retained earnings).
- Trend: Improved from FY2023 (~13.41) due to higher EBIT and market valuation.
