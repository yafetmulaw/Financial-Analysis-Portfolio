# Assessing Earnings Quality of Colgate-Palmolive (FY2023–2024)

This project evaluates the earnings quality and potential manipulation risk of Colgate-Palmolive Company using three established forensic and fundamental analysis models:

- **Beneish M-Score** → Detects earnings manipulation (result: -2.616 → low probability)
- **Piotroski F-Score** → Assesses financial strength (result: 7 → strong fundamentals)
- **Modified C-Score** → Checks for earnings quality red flags (result: 0 modifiers → no concerns)

The analysis confirms high-quality, sustainable earnings supported by stable cash flows, improved working capital efficiency, and no accounting irregularities.

## Key Findings Summary
- **Beneish M-Score**: -2.616 (well below -2.22 threshold → not a manipulator)
- **Piotroski F-Score**: 7/9 (strong profitability, leverage reduction, efficiency gains)
- **Modified C-Score**: No red flags (OCF tracks net income, receivables/inventory improved, conservative asset trends)
