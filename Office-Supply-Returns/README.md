# Analytical Report on Office Supply Returns

This repository contains an analytical report on office supply return behavior, focusing on how timing and customer segments impact profitability. Using transactional data summarized through dashboard analytics, the report evaluates return patterns across Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments.
It identifies profit erosion drivers (e.g., late returns) and recommends segment-specific policy adjustments to balance financial risk and customer service. Key themes: Consumer returns cause the most damage (13% profit impact, often after 60 days), while Corporate/Home Office returns are earlier and less costly.

## Summary Findings

- **Profit Impact**: Returns erode profits measurably; Consumers drive 13% of total loss, Corporate 6%, Home Office 4% (Figure 1: Pie chart breakdown).
- **Return Timing**: Early returns (under 30-60 days) are less damaging due to resale potential. Corporate/Home Office cluster here, suggesting disciplined behavior (Figure 2: Frequency bars over time).
- **Segment Differences**: Consumers show high variability and late-return concentration (>60 days), increasing costs from depreciation/logistics (Figure 3: Comparative bars by days).
- **Trends**: Late Consumer returns are the biggest risk; others align with business cycles.
- **Policy Insights**: Stricter terms for Consumers (e.g., 60-day limits, fees) could reduce leakage without harming other segments.
