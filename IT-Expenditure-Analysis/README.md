# IT Expenditure Analysis

This repository contains a detailed **IT Expenditure Analysis Report** and supporting dataset analyzing organizational IT spending. The analysis uses structured financial data (81,610 records) to evaluate actual, forecast, and planned expenditures across regions, business areas, IT domains, and cost elements.
It assesses spending distribution, alignment between planning and execution, and provides insights for IT financial governance, strategic decision-making, and addressing execution gaps.

## Highlights include:
- Strong planning discipline (Plan: $900.4M | Forecast: $890.5M), but significant execution lag (Actual YTD: $555.7M, ~10% variance).
- Europe dominates spending; emerging regions show higher planned growth.
- Labor-heavy cost structure (salaries & shared services as major drivers).
- Variances highest in BU Support, Functional IT, and R&D business areas.

## Summary Findings

- **Overall Spending**: Actual spend trails plan and forecast significantly (YTD variance ~$55.6M or 10%), suggesting deferred spending, timing delays, or reprioritization.
- **Regional Distribution**: Europe leads across all measures (Very High); mature markets dominate, while Africa/Asia and Latin America show potential future expansion.
- **IT Functional Areas**: BU Support and Functional IT are top contributors (Very High); Enablement and Governance have higher planned/forecast vs actual (indicating pending initiatives).
- **Cost Structure**: Predominantly labor-driven (Salaries & Wages largest); Depreciation & Amortization, Hardware/Software follow.
- **Business Areas**: Highest variances in R&D ($17.9M Plan vs Actual), BU ($15.4M), and Infrastructure ($11.9M).
- **Trends**: Robust forecasting and governance; execution challenges persist. Addressing gaps critical for value realization.
