# Sales Performance Analysis  

This repository contains a detailed Sales Performance Analysis Report and supporting dataset analyzing organizational sales activity. The analysis uses structured transactional data (daily records across regions, products, customer types, and sales representatives) to evaluate sales distribution, identify top performers, assess regional and product-level trends, and provide insights for sales strategy and resource allocation.  


## Highlights  

- **Regional Leaders:** West region dominates overall sales, followed by South; North and East contribute moderately.  
- **Product Mix:** Paper consistently generates higher revenue than Staplers, underscoring its role as the core product line.  
- **Customer Segments:** Enterprise accounts deliver the largest share of revenue, while Consumer accounts sustain recurring demand.  
- **Top Performers:** Dwight leads in enterprise accounts and new product growth (Staplers), Pam excels in Paper sales, Michael shows consistent performance across regions, and Jim contributes steadily in Consumer Paper.  
- **Promotion Recommendation:** Based on sustained performance and enterprise growth, Dwight is recommended for internal promotion.
